# Sprint 1 Report

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Basic User Interface Set Up
 * Adding Items to a Cart

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint I worked on establishing the basic UI of my application as well as trying to complete one feature, adding items to a cart. This sprint proved quite challenging as I navigated tools and technologies unfamiliar to me. My goal with this sprint was to become more proficient in the tools and technologies I am currently using and set up a strong foundation so later sprints can focus on adding more features. 

## Unfinished Work
I had one unfinished feature which is the user interface. I intended for this feature to likely remain unfinished as user interface can evolve and change as I add or remove features in future sprints. That being said, a very basic user interface with core interactions has been put in place to model what the application could look like.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:

 * https://github.com/hdang04/CPTS322-Project/pull/10
 
 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * https://github.com/hdang04/CPTS322-Project/issues/9
This feature is subject to change as development continues because the user interface may change drastically as features are added or removed. Additionally, decisions around the UI may change as the application progresses.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Add to cart feature works 
  * Application works on the web and on mobile
  * Organized tasks led to easier time working on development
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Spending more time working on features
   * Project setup was slow, delaying development
   * Unfamiliarity with technologies caused some issues very early on
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Begin work on development earlier in the sprint
   * Remember to occasionally push code during the middle of sprints to mark progression
   * Focus on one feature at a time
