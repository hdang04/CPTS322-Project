## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint I worked on trying to establish as many features as possible for my application. The goal of this sprint was to try to finish nearly all of the core functions needed in a restaurant application. The experience I gained from sprint 1 helped me organize a much more successful sprint that involved more tangible progress being made to the project.
